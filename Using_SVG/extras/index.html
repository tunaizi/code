        These online extras were originally written to be part of <cite>Using SVG with CSS3 and HTML5</cite>, but were cut during editing.
        Which isn't to say that these are the cheap cuts—far from it!
        Some of our favorite examples are here.
        In many cases, these sections were extracted because they are complete articles that can stand on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The printed book is just over 800 pages long, 
        with 20 chapters, 
        115 complete examples (and numerous short code snippets), 
        189 figures, 
        and 141 browser support warnings.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it still didn't include everything we wanted to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these are extra explanation of the concepts and connections.
        Some are extended tangents about browser bugs and work-arounds.
        And many are just interesting applications of SVG on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll find the example files for the extras in the same folders in the <a href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/Using_SVG/">Github repo</a> as the files for the chapter they're associated with.

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The Big Picture: <i>SVG and the Web</i>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="ch02-web-platform.html">“The Web Platform”</a>: The web platform is the interconnected set of standards used by websites and browsers: HTML, CSS, HTTP, URLs, JavaScript, the DOM. And SVG.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A Sense of Style: <i>Working with CSS</i>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="ch03-cascade.html">“The Cascade”</a>: The CSS cascade mostly works the same for SVG as for HTML. But that doesn't mean that it is simple.</li>
          <li><a href="ch03-media-queries.html">“Media Queries in Embedded Versus Inline SVG”</a>: Media queries can be used with inline SVG and in standalone SVG files. But if you switch between the two, you’ll often need to make adjustments.</li>
          <li><a href="ch03-namespaces.html">“XML Namespaces in CSS”</a>: You can usually ignore XML namespaces when writing CSS selectors, but that makes it all the more surprising when they cause a problem.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Tools of the Trade: <i>Software and Sources to Make SVG Easier</i>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="ch04-rasterizers.html">“SVG Snapshots: Converting Vector to Raster”</a>: Sometimes, you need a “snapshot” image of an SVG, saved in a common raster (aka, bitmap) image format, such as PNG or JPEG.  The conversion can often be automated using dedicated rasterization tools.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Building Blocks: <i>Basic Shapes</i>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="ch05-percentages.html">“Perplexing Percentages”</a>: Most SVG lengths are proportional to the viewBox width or height. But some values aren't either horizontal or vertical.</li>

      <li>Following Your Own Path: <i>Custom Shapes</i>
        <ul>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="ch07-dataURI-fonts.html">“Creating Embeddable Fonts as Data URIs”</a>: The old SVG <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> element to include a font in an SVG file doesn't work on the web. Data URIs do.</li>
          <li><a href="ch07-interactive-labels.html">“Interactive Text”</a>: Don't bake-in labels on your photos: add them with SVG text, and you can style them dynamically.</li>
          <li><a href="ch07-rotate-vertical.html">“Beyond Horizontal: Rotated and Vertical Text”</a>: Horizontal text is so HTML. SVG was designed for more than that. And now, CSS is too.</li>
          <li><a href="ch07-textpaths.html">“Perfecting Paths for &lt;textPath&gt;”</a>: Tips for mastering geometry when wrapping SVG text around shapes.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>Scaling Up: <i>Defining Coordinate Systems</i>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="ch08-precision.html">“The Limits of Numbers in SVG”</a>: SVG coordinates are scalable, independent of pixels. But in practice, you can't use just any scale you choose.</li>

        <ul>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="ch12-bounding-boxes.html">“objectBoundingBox versus userSpaceOnUse”</a>: SVG graphical effects can be defined in terms of the bounding box of the element they apply to or its user-space coordinate system. But what does that really mean?</li>

      </li>

        <ul>
          <li>(none)</li>
